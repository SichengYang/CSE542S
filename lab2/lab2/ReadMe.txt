CSE 542 Fall 2024 Lab 1

## Basic Information about Project

* Group member:
Qinzhou Song qinzhounick@wustl.edu
Sicheng Yang sicheng@wustl.edu

* Program Design
This program will generate scribe text based on configuration and each character's speaking. Our program
will first read the configuration file and collect each character's speaking based on the configuration.
After reading the text, our program will sort the scribe based on order provided and output the scribe on
the screen. If the user enable whinge mode, we will also print out warning message related to error format.

* Observations:
We find the collaboration in project is harder than we thought. I think we can talk about how to write 
collaborate code in class. Especially how to pack everybody's program together(eliminating errors).

* Testing:


* How to unpack the program: download the lab.zip and unzip the package

* How to build the program:
1. Please put all the file under lab1 folder
2. use "rustc ./src/main.rs" to compile the program
3. you can use "./main <configuration file>" to ignore warning message or 
"./main <configuration file> whinge" to enable warning message. You can also use "cargo run <configuration file>"
or "cargo run <configuration file> whinge"
